SPECIAL NOTES:
Pclass is a proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
 1st ~ Upper; 2nd ~ Middle; 3rd ~ Lower

Age is in Years; Fractional if Age less than One (1)
 If the Age is Estimated, it is in the form xx.5

With respect to the family relation variables (i.e. sibsp and parch)
some relations were ignored.  The following are the definitions used
for sibsp and parch.

Sibling:  Brother, Sister, Stepbrother, or Stepsister of Passenger Aboard Titanic
Spouse:   Husband or Wife of Passenger Aboard Titanic (Mistresses and Fiances Ignored)
Parent:   Mother or Father of Passenger Aboard Titanic
Child:    Son, Daughter, Stepson, or Stepdaughter of Passenger Aboard Titanic

Other family relatives excluded from this study include cousins,
nephews/nieces, aunts/uncles, and in-laws.  Some children travelled
only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.  As well, some
travelled with very close friends or neighbors in a village, however,
the definitions do not support such relations.


Evaluation

The historical data has been split into two groups, a 'training set' and a 'test set'.  For the training set, we provide the outcome ( 'ground truth' ) for each passenger.  You will use this set to build your model to generate predictions for the test set.

For each passenger in the test set, you must predict whether or not they survived the sinking ( 0 for deceased, 1 for survived ).  Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict. (True positive?)

 The Kaggle leaderboard has a public and private component.  50% of your predictions for the test set have been randomly assigned to the public leaderboard ( the same 50% for all users ).  Your score on this public portion is what will appear on the leaderboard.  At the end of the contest, we will reveal your score on the private 50% of the data, which will determine the final winner.  This method prevents users from 'overfitting' to the leaderboard.
